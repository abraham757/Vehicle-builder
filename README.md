# Vehicle Builder
  

  ## Description
The Vehicle builder is a TypeScript command-line application that currently focuses on building and using cars, we can enhance its functionality by adding options for motorbikes and trucks. This update will involve modifying the existing codebase to include new classes and interfaces that represent motorbikes and trucks, similar to how cars are currently structured. By defining their unique properties, such as color, make, and model, we ensure that each vehicle type maintains its distinct characteristics. Additionally, we will modify the command-line interface to allow users to select between cars, motorbikes, and trucks when building vehicles. This might include options for specifying the number of wheels, towing capacity , and other specifications relevant to each vehicle type. We should also add validation to ensure that the provided inputs meet the requirements for each vehicle type, helping users avoid mistakes. Furthermore, incorporating helpful messages and prompts will make the application more user-friendly.  Ultimately, this update will make the application more versatile and appealing to a wider audience of vehicle enthusiasts.

Once the user selects or creates a vehicle, they can perform various actions, like viewing details, editing information, or deleting the vehicle. After each action, the user is returned to the main actions menu, allowing them to easily choose another action or return to the vehicle selection screen.
